		<br>which is believed to have started or formed in 2008 when the three members of the group(QUAVO,OFFSET and TAKEOFF)<br> 
		<br>recognised each others talents and believed they could acomplish great things together (the group suddenly broke up <br>
		<br>in late 2022 due to unknown reseans with OFFSET going his own way and TAKEOFF and QUAVO sticking together and forming<br>
		<br>a duo they called UNC and PHEW.The name came from the fact that QUAVO was TAKEOFF's uncle.Sadly the duo came to a quick<br>
		<br>end when TAKEOFF was shot to deadth on the 1st of November 2022 (RIP THE <strong>ROCKET</strong>)</p><br></div>
